# Placement Training

Since placement season is coming I will be learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms and maintain this repository for future reference, all the topics or questions that I practice during this session would be updated here.

### Note
- To Maintain the streaks some codes which I could not solve have been referred from the Solutions Section of LEETCODE.
- Some Programmes may not have Testing Codes in them but these codes are only here if they were passed in LEETCODE so all the solutions are 100% Working

## Topics Covered

- [01 Sliding Window](./01%20Sliding%20Window/)
- [02 Two Pointer](./02%20Two%20Pointer/)
- [03 Bitwise XOR](./03%20Bitwise%20XOR/)
- [04 Linked List](./04%20Linked%20List/)
- [05 Trees](./05%20Trees/)
- [06 Stacks](./06%20Stack%20Data%20Structure/)
- [07 Strings](./07%20Strings/)
- [08 Hashmap](./08%20Hashmap/)
