# Placement Training

Since placement season is coming I will be learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms and maintain this repository for future reference, all the topics or questions that I practice during this session would be updated here.

### Note
- To Maitain the streaks some codes which I could not solve have been referred from the Solutions Section of LEETCODE.
- Some Programmes may not have Testing Codes in them but these codes are only here if they were passed in LEETCODE so all the solutions are 100% Working

## Topics Covered

- [01 Sliding Window](./01%20Sliding%20Window/)
- [02 Two Pointer](./02%20Two%20Pointer/)
