Hint
You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.

A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.

A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b. For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.

You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.

Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):
- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.
- The longest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.
- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.
The longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.
Note that common prefixes between elements of the same array do not count.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 108
